- Troubleshooting with R01 Board:
  1. Identified error in VCO circuit which caused frequency instability: 
     ripple in vref due to no filtering. Will fix with bypass caps to GND.
  2. Trying to come up with method to test PA. Issues involved:
        a. need matched impedance interface w/ o'scope, can't get with simple jumper
           and o-scope probe. 
        b. 
- Layout Respin:
  1. Fixed MAX2750 footprint error in PCB library, re-added to layout.
  2. Added connector to board
  3. Re-routed power traces on LYR3 (PWR-GND) and signal traces as necessary on LYR 4 (SIG2).
  4. Added test point for freq-volt converter, broke out signal for interface w/ ADC.
  5. Cleaned up DRC errors. 
  6. Cleaned up some awkward placement of parts which proved troublesome last semester.

- Summary: 
  Layout respin completion: 80%. Est. Date of Completion: 2/4/2022
  Troubleshooting errors from R01 board: 40%. Est. Date of Completion: 2/3/2022

- Notes: 
  Limited success with troubleshooting the PA/LNA due to test interface. Need 
  some method of interfacing thru an SMA connector so that impedances are matched, 
  otherwise nothing is read at o'scope even though device is operational. 
  
  need to get access to a spectrum analyzer up to and beyond 2.5GHz.
